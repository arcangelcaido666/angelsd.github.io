hi guys! i'm ángel!

based in salamanca (for now). first gen graduate and phd econ student. my interests are `labour`, `policy`, `causal inference` and many more, my main problem is that days are constrained to 24 hours!

my phd explores `ageing` and `policy evaluation`. mental health, inheritances, social contacts... a bunch of topics through `impact evaluation` glasses and `quasi-experimental` techniques. if you are curious, go to cv to know a little bit more, there are some interesting working papers in the kitchen.

i'm a stata-guy for `econometrics` stuff and an r-guy for `data visualization`. python is on my wishlist to learn this year. i keep up with all the new ai tools, i believe critical thinking will be more crucial than ever, although i hope claude code does not replace my job.

additionally, i teach a couple of courses to economics undergraduates and, so far, i'm loving it. students really push me to stay updated on lots of topics.

I am also on [substack](https://substack.com/@litoangel)
